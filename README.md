<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-monorepo-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Technology - NX, NestJS

- This repo was created using NX (monorepo workspace management) with NestJS (application framework). For Java developers, NestJS is like Spring Boot, an opinionated, powerful and convenient application framework.

- Here is a quick tutorial using NX to create workspace with NestJS microservice - [Setting up a Monorepo with NX for React & NestJS](https://dev.to/kevelopment/setting-up-a-monorepo-with-nx-for-react-nestjs-1o55)

- Quick tutorial on NestJS - [Getting Started with NestJS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-nestjs)

- Easy to read NestJS official documentation - [Documentation | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps)

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
cd mono
```

```sh
npx nx serve client
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build client
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project client
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
